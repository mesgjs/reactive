proxy = reactiveBundle(bundle)

* _ - The collection of member reactives/values
* __ - The bundle's master reactive
*   This reactive ripples a change when a member is added or removed
*   from the collection (in contrast to member value changes)
* join(sep = ',') - In array mode, returns _values().join(sep)
* length = value - Sets the array length in array mode
*   The length may be either a plain number or a reactive number
* length - Returns the *reactive* array length in array mode
*   This value reacts to assignments, push/pop, shift/unshift, splice, etc.
* member = value - Sets a bundle member to a value
*   Non-reactive values are promoted to reactive values upon assignment
*   unless the value is a function or the key (member) is a symbol.
* member - Returns the member's reactive
* member.rv - The member's current value for reactive.type values
* _values() - Returns a plain array of the underlying, non-reactive values

Standard array operations on array bundles happen in a reactive batch, and
array-valued functions return an array bundle (proxy).
